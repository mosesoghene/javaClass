STAGE 1
collect 5 integer numbers from user
count how many are negative, positive, and zero value
display result

STAGE 2
declare and initialize variables negativeCount, positiveCount, and zeroCount to 0
declare and initialize valriable loopCount to 5
prompt user to enter integer input
collect user input and store as dataInput
check if dataInput > 0
if True, increase positiveCount by 1, decrease loopCount by 1
else check if dataInput < 0
if True, increase negativeCount by 1, decrease loopCount by 1
else, increase zeroCount by 1, decrease loopCount by 1
repeat step 3 - 9 while loopCount > 0

display results
