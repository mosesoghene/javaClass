STAGE 1
collect integer between 0 - 1000 from user
sum all individual integers
display result

STAGE 2
prompt user to enter input between 0 - 1000
collect user input
store input as data

check if data > 0
	if True, check if data > 99
		if true, divide data by 10 using modulo operator %
		save as lastNum
		divide data by 10 using division operator /
		save as tempData
		divide tempData by 10 using modulo operator %
		save as midNum
		divide tempData by 10 using division operator /
		save as firstNum
		sum firstNum + midNum + lastNum
		save as total
		display total
	if False, divide data by 10 using modulo operator %
		save as lastNum
		divide data by 10 using division operator /
		save as firstNum
		sum firstNum + lastNum
		save as total
		display total
if False, display "number out of range"
